        "This week, you'll transform your financial decision-making skills into **modular, reusable functions**. Working in Google Colab, you'll learn how organizing code into functions makes it more readable, testable, and professional—even within a notebook environment.\n",

        "**Duration:** 1-3 hours  \n",
        "**Goal:** Apply function definition, parameters, return values, and the `datetime` module to create a modular finance toolkit\n",

        "\n",
        "- Define functions with meaningful parameters and return values\n",
        "- Break complex financial logic into smaller, reusable components  \n",
        "- Organize code into logical \"modules\" using notebook cells\n",
        "- Import and use the `datetime` module for timestamps\n",
        "- Experience how modular design improves code organization and reusability\n",
        "- Practice AI-assisted programming with constraint-based prompts"

        "For students who completed Weeks 3-4:\n",
        "- Transform your existing tracker code into modular functions\n",
        "- Add new features using proper function design\n",
        "- Experience the benefits of refactoring legacy code\n",
